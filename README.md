Precision in flight stability is a fundamental requirement for high-powered rocketry, directly influencing both mission safety and performance outcomes. Roll instability, in particular, can degrade aerodynamic efficiency, increase structural loading, and induce trajectory dispersions that compromise recovery reliability and payload success. Slender body rockets can be more inclined to experience unpredicted trajectories due to high roll rates. 

In the context of university and amateur rocketry programs, including the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC), NASA Student Launch Initiative (SLI), and the Friends of Amateur Rocketry OUT (FAR-OUT) competition, teams must address stability challenges while operating under strict limitations of weight, cost, and manufacturability. Competition-class rockets typically have masses between 20-40 kg, operate with peak dynamic pressures of 8–15 kPa, and are constrained to commercially available manufacturing processes. Within these regimes, any solution for roll stabilization must provide sufficient control authority while adding less than 1–2 percent to system mass and maintaining costs below approximately $500.

Conventional passive stabilization techniques, such as canted fins, generate roll torque through induced aerodynamic asymmetry but result in drag penalties that reduce apogee depending on Mach number and cant angle. Advanced active approaches, including thrust vector control, cold-gas thrusters, and reaction wheels, offer greater precision but impose significant penalties in mass, power, and cost. Consequently, there remains a clear technical gap for a lightweight, modular, and reliable roll control system tailored to the needs of competition-class rocketry.

The Active Rocket Control System (ARCS) project is conceived to address this gap by introducing an aerodynamic fin-based actuation mechanism capable of dynamically correcting roll during supersonic flight. The system integrates aerodynamic control surfaces with embedded actuation and onboard sensing, enabling closed-loop control of roll rates while minimizing drag penalties. The design emphasizes modularity, allowing integration into existing vehicles with minimal airframe modification, while maintaining manufacturability with student-accessible processes. Beyond roll control, the framework can be expanded to multi-axis stabilization, thereby serving as an enabling technology for advanced trajectory shaping, payload protection, and recovery optimization in future university-level aerospace programs.
